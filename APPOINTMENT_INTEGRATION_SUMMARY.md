# Comprehensive Appointment Integration System

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive appointment tracking system that automatically integrates appointments from all sections (Services, Marketplace, Messages, and Progress) into the calendar. This creates a unified scheduling system across the entire application.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Database Schema**
- **Extended Appointment Model** with:
  - Source tracking (`source`, `sourceId`)
  - Related entity references (`serviceId`, `propertyId`, `transactionId`)
  - Multi-party participants system
  - Status tracking and metadata
  - New appointment types for all use cases

- **New Enums Added**:
  - `AppointmentSource`: MANUAL, SERVICE_BOOKING, PROPERTY_VIEWING, PROGRESS_MILESTONE, MESSAGE_SCHEDULING
  - `AppointmentStatus`: SCHEDULED, CONFIRMED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, RESCHEDULED
  - `AppointmentType`: Added SERVICE_CONSULTATION, PROPERTY_VIEWING, PROPERTY_TOUR, MEETING, CALL
  - `ParticipantRole` & `ParticipantStatus` for multi-party meetings

### 2. **Enhanced Calendar Actions**
- **`createServiceAppointment()`**: Creates appointments from service bookings
- **`createPropertyViewingAppointment()`**: Creates appointments from property viewing requests
- **`createTransactionAppointment()`**: Creates appointments from transaction milestones
- **Enhanced `getUserAppointments()`**: Fetches appointments with full context and participant information

### 3. **Service Booking Integration**
- **ServiceBookingDialog Component**: Full-featured booking dialog with:
  - Date/time selection
  - Duration options (30min - 2hrs)
  - Location specification
  - Custom messages
  - Automatic appointment creation
  - Provider notification system

- **Updated Services Page**: Added "Book" buttons to all service cards with integrated scheduling

### 4. **Marketplace Property Integration**
- **PropertyViewingDialog Component**: Property viewing scheduler with:
  - Multiple viewing types (Tour, Inspection, Walkthrough)
  - Date/time selection
  - Duration options
  - Custom messages
  - Automatic appointment creation with property owner

- **Updated Property Cards**: Added "Tour" and "Schedule Tour" buttons for immediate booking

### 5. **Progress/Transaction Integration**
- **Automatic Closing Appointments**: When transactions are created with closing dates:
  - Automatically creates closing appointments
  - Sets appropriate time windows (2 hours before/after)
  - Includes property location and transaction details
  - Links to transaction for context

### 6. **Messages Integration**
- **MessageAppointmentDialog Component**: Meeting scheduler from messages with:
  - Meeting type selection
  - Date/time scheduling
  - Location specification
  - Meeting agenda/notes
  - Direct integration with calendar

### 7. **Enhanced Calendar Display**
- **Source Context**: Appointments show their origin (Service, Property, Transaction, Message)
- **Enhanced Titles**: Contextual titles based on source
- **Rich Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions with relevant information
- **New Appointment Types**: Support for all new appointment types with appropriate icons and colors
